# MGMSDNet: Multi-Gradient Multi-Scale Attention-Driven Denoiser Network

Welcome to the official repository for **MGMSDNet**, an innovative image denoising network designed to balance denoising effectiveness and computational efficiency.

## üåü Abstract

Image denoising is a critical task in computer vision with applications in:

- Medical imaging
- Remote sensing
- Photography

Despite the significant advancements in deep learning, key challenges remain:

1. **Network Depth Issues**: Many denoisers rely heavily on deeper networks, which often lead to training difficulties and diminishing performance gains.
2. **Gradient Neglect**: Existing models frequently underestimate the role of gradient information in the denoising process.
3. **Computational Costs**: The trade-off between noise reduction and detail preservation often comes at a high computational expense.

### Introducing **MGMSDNet**
**MGMSDNet**, or **Multi-Gradient Multi-Scale Attention-Driven Denoiser Network**, addresses these limitations by introducing a novel **Gradient Guidance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with integrated attention mechanisms. This network incorporates:

- **Multidirectional Gradient Information**: Utilizing gradient data from various directions to enhance edge preservation.
- **Negative Image Features**: Leveraging complementary image information for improved denoising accuracy.
- **Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms**: Focusing on noise-prone regions across multiple scales for precise feature extraction.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the **first study** to explore multidirectional gradients for image denoising.
